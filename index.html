    <h1><center>ABOUT US</center></h1>
    <p>Tasty Delights Bakery is a bakery that was designed and is located on Nairobi-Mombasa-road in Nairobi County, 3 kilometers from Nairobi town. Tasty Delights began as a small shop in 2005 by James Gitau, who started it with the small capital he had saved and borrowed from friends and family. The shop was only a small kiosk at the time, and James could only order baked goods from other wholesale bakeries. There was an increase in product sales, and James made a lot of money in 2008, so he decided to expand the shop. Cakes were now purchased in bulk from wholesalers. The size of the land was too small for him due to an increase in the firm's operation, and he decided to incorporate the company. Tasty Delights became known throughout Nairobi in 2010, and it was now launched as a bakery after James Gitau was granted the license. Tasty Delights Bakery majorly deals with production of cakes and selling them to the clients. </p>
